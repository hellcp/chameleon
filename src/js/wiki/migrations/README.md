# Bento Migration Scripts

Bento is the default skin openSUSE wiki before Chameleon. Here are still many
templates and pages using Bento styles and components. To avoid modifying all
content manually, we write those JavaScript and stylesheets to convert these UI
elements to Chameleon (Bootstrap 4).

All Bento components in page content should look normal, usable, and comfortable
in Chameleon.

To test these legacy, you can check the following pages:
