# MediaWiki Hacking Scripts

MediaWiki syntax doesn't support full HTML features. For example, you cannot add
class to link or image, `<p>` tag will wrap new lines. This folder contains some
special scripts that convert non-perfect MediaWiki content to valid Bootstrap
components.

There isn't any JavaScript for wiki UI. They should be inside the wiki project.
